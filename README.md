The pure Levenshtein Distance algorithm is simpler and faster than the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm, making it more effective in scenarios where transposition errors are less common. The Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm is more complex and computationally expensive due to the additional operation of transposition of adjacent characters. However, in scenarios where transposition errors are common, the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm may provide better results. For verifying bank account names, where transposition errors are less common, the pure Levenshtein Distance algorithm may be sufficient.
